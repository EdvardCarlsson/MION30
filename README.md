# MION30
Valuation of the operating model for the joint rescue service in two municipalities in the south of Sweden. 

In the Lund University course "Industriall Management" (MION30) (Autumn semester 2020) my assignment was to work togehter with the municipalities of Lomma and Staffanstorp with the task to valuate their operating model and give them an outside analysis on wheter or not it was a motivated path forward.

The project moslty consisted qualitative analysis work including surveys and interviews with workers and stakeholders but also some quantitative and statistical aspects. In this reposatory this type of work is compliled. I've choosen to annonumize all data for pricacy reasons, but are fully accessable by anyone through "offentlighetsprincipen".
