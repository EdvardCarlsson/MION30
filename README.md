Valuation of the operating model for the joint rescue service in two municipalities in the south of Sweden. 

In the Lund University course "Industriall Management" (MION30) (Autumn semester 2020) my assignment was to work togehter with two municipalities in the south of Sweden with the task to valuate their rescue services operating model and give them an outside analysis on wheter or not it was a motivated path forward.

The project mostly consisted of qualitative analysis work including surveys and interviews with workers and stakeholders but also some quantitative and statistical aspects. In this repository, this type of work is compiled. I've chosen to anonymize all data for privacy reasons, but are fully accessible by anyone through "offentlighetsprincipen".
