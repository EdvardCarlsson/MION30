Valuation of the operating model for the joint rescue service in two municipalities in the south of Sweden. 

In the Lund University course "Industrial Management" (MION30) (Autumn semester 2020) my assignment was to work together with two municipalities in the south of Sweden with the task to evaluate their rescue services operating model and give them an outside analysis on whether or not it was a motivated path forward.

The project mostly consisted of qualitative analysis work including surveys and interviews with workers and stakeholders since it is a management course. But I also made the effort to do some quantitative and statistical work in order to get a better base for decision making. In this repository, this type of work is compiled. I've chosen to anonymize all data for privacy reasons, but it is fully accessible by anyone through "offentlighetsprincipen".
